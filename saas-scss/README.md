# css-and-scss
this is a project to learn css and scss. I really love this tutorial

# To Run the project

## install the dependencies
run npm install to install whatever specified in package.json

## convert scss to css
run > npm run sass:build
this will create dist folder having equivalent code of scss written.

## run > npm start
that's it
